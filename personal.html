<b>Rhythmic Gymnastics</b><br>
<br>

I did rhythmic gymnastics competitively from 7 years old to 14, when I retired and became a coach. Now I train girls in the artistry of rhythmic gymnastics, building their skills, passion, and love for the sport. This requires me to teach them to be strong, graceful, and flexible gymnasts, while also disciplining them. In the process I get to personally know each gymnast, analyzing their strengths and weaknesses, and then applying that to a course of training more geared towards their improvement. I strive to challenge them physically, mentally, and emotionally, and feel utmost pride as they become better and better. This process is as rewarding for me as it is for them, and I am grateful to continue being involved in my own passion and to bring that joy into the lives of others.<br>
