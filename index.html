  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hello everyone! My name is Margaret Misyutina, and welcome to my website. I am 17 years old and a senior of Canyon Crest Academy, hoping to go to UCLA for applied mathematics and finance/accounting. I am determined, hard-working, and passionate for an array of topics, including dance, rhythmic gymnastics, and volunteer work. I love my job, in which I train children in the artistry of rhythmic gymnastics, building their skills, passion, and love for the sport. I also love my home and family, and am extremely grateful to live in the beautiful city of San Diego. On this webpage, you will dive deeper into my life, learning more about me and my interests.</p>
