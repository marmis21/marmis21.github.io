<i>Personal Movie Review:</i><br>
A Cure For Wellness has the great merit of being different, and to reward the movie goer with something that stands out from the crowd, which is an aspect I appreciate greatly. As the sister of an amazing cinematographer, I canâ€™t help but notice the exquisite camerawork involved in this film. Even if you're not a fan of mystery or suspense, Bazelli's cinematography for "A Cure For Wellness' will leave you floored, the word breathtaking doesn't even begin to fairly describe it. There are shots through the tunnel, around the castle, and even during some of the film's most disturbing moments, they draw you in, gorgeous in every possible way. And the fact that they actually filmed a big chunk on location at Castle Hohenzollern in Germany does help because the place becomes a supporting role.<br>
